#How to run it:

* Clone the repository.
* Open a console.
* Navigate to the repository directory and run npm install to download the project's package.
* Run npm simpleServer.js to start serving the files in Localhost over port 8000.
* Open another console.
* Navigato to the repository directory and run ./ngrok http 8000.
* Copy the url given by ngrok and paste it in PageSpeed Insights to analyze it.
* Open your browser and navigate to localhost port 8000 to view the website.
* Navigate to /views/pizza.html and record a scroll event to confirm ~60fps.
* Slide the Pizza Slider and confirm a less than 5ms on the execution.

##Dependencies: 

* Ngrok (provided in the repository).
* Node.js installed.

##Alterations: 

###Index

* Enabled Cache-Control and Emap tokens in simpleServer.js configurations.
* Enabled Gzip compression in simpleServer.js configurations.
* Minimized external JS file and the html.
* Inlined CSS (since it wasn't too large) ir order to avoid another download blocking the parser/JS engine. 
* Compressed images using responsive-images gulp plugin.
* Simplified the tasks of minization and compression using Gulp.

###Pizza

* Removed the layout check from inside the iterator to prevent forced reflow.
* Reworked the logics of the slider function to simplify unnecessary complexity and restrain DOM querying to a minimum.

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
